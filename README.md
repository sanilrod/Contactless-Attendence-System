# Contactless Attendence System
 
<p> Uniqueness or individuality of an individual face is the representation of one’s identity. In this
project face of an individual is used for the purpose of attendance making automatically.
Attendance of the teacher is very important for every college, universities and school.
Conventional methodology for taking attendance is by Biometric thumb or register of the
teachers and the attendance is recorded. Time consumption for this purpose is an important
point of concern. To stay away from these losses, an automatic process is used in this project
which is based on image processing. In this project face detection and face recognition is used.
Face detection is used to locate the position of face region and face recognition is used for
marking the understudy’s attendance. The database of all the teachers in the college is stored
and when the face of the individual teachers matches with one of the faces stored in the
database then the attendance is recorded.</p>
